# Bellabeat Data Analysis Project
The capstone project for my **Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate**.


## Introduction:
For this case study, I am tasked with performing real-world tasks of a Junior Data Analyst. I took the 2nd track that was offered - analysis of health-focused products made by Bellabeat.

I will be going through the six steps of the data analysis process:
Ask, Prepare, Process, Identify, Share and Act.

## Scenario given:
I am to assume the role of a junior data analyst working at Bellabeat. I am asked to analyze the data generated by the various products in order to gain insight into how consumers are using the smart devices. This will overall help guide the marketing strategy of the company.

Bellabeat products that are used are Bellabeat app, Leaf, Time, Spring and Bellabeat membership.

I will be presenting my analysis along with my high level recommendations towards the end.

## About the company:
Bellabeat is a health-focused tech company founded by Urška Sršen and Sando Mur. They design smart products to inform and inspire women about their health. Bellabeat has grown rapidly since its founding in 2013. The company uses a variety of marketing channels to reach its target audience. Urška Sršen believes that analyzing consumer data can reveal opportunities for growth. She tasked the marketing analytics team to analyze smart device usage data to inform Bellabeat's marketing strategy.

### 1. Ask
The CEO has tasked me with analyze the smart device usage data in order to gain insight into how consumers use non-Bellabeat smart devices. Then I am asked to select one Bellabeat product to apply these insights to in my presentation.

The questions are:
1. What are some trends in smart device usage? 
– These would be the increased focus on health and wellness, habitual daily use and growth in home connected devices.
2. How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?
– These trends could apply to Bellabeat customers in emphasising the company’s focus on health products and the fashionable aspect of the product.
3. How could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy?
– Bellabeat can benefit from these trends by analysing the daily use by customers, and identifying well-performing products. They can then invest into marketing these products more, and also find the under-performing products to improve upon.


### 2. Prepare
For this phase, I was guided to use the FitBit Fitness Tracker Data (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit/code) .

The data was of the .csv file type, and was in the long format.

I applied the ROCCC process to the data. (Reliable, Original, Comprehensive, Current and Cited) which allowed me to address bias and credibility issues for the data. From my analysis the data is consistent.

The data is open-source, and is given by 30 eligible FitBit users tracking their minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate and sleep monitoring. It also included daily activity, steps, and heart rate.

I downloaded the dataset, and stored it in a secure folder. The data was organized on various metrics and timeframes, such as hourlySteps and minuteSteps, while heartrate is measured in terms of seconds. 

### 3. Process
For this phase, I’ll be using Python, along with the Pandas library to process the data. 

Firstly, I’ll be preparing the environment.

### Verifying Unique Users:

### Checking null values:

![](/images/12.png)

We can see that there are 65 null values in weight_log. So we drop that.

### Checking Duplicates:

### Examining the Datatypes:

![](/images/16.png)

![](/images/17.png)

![](/images/18.png)

### From this data, I learned that:

There are no duplicates.
weight_log, heart_rate data are below n>=30 rule, so I drop these from analysis.
sleep_daily and daily_activity has n>=30 (or close to it.)

### Transforming the Data:

I will be converting the ActivityDate and SleepDay from object to datetime64, and converting format to yyyy-mm-dd.

![](/images/19.png)

I will do the same for sleep_daily.

I will create a new column, separating date into day of the week.

### Rearranging and renaming columns;

![](/images/22.png)

Next, I create a new column total_mins being the sum of total time registered.

![](/images/23.png)

Now I create a new column by converting total_mins to number of hours.

Merging these two tables,

### 4. Analyze 

Now that the data has been processed and data cleaning methods have been utilised, I begin analyzing the data.

Checking the merged_df:

### Findings:

- Users logged **8,177** steps on average daily. An adult female is to aim for at least 10,000 steps (8 kilometres) to benefit from health and fitness improvement. (Source: Medical News Today)
- Users burned an average of **2,329** calories per day. There is a positive correlation between steps taken and calories burnt.
- Out of **1218** Total minutes, **991** minutes were spent inactive (Sedentary). Approximately, 228 active minutes were spent.

### 5. Share

I will be visualizing my analysis through various graphical methods.

### Clear View of Calorie Burning
The scatterplot effectively shows how steps taken and sedentary minutes affect calorie burning. We see a positive trend: more steps burn more calories. In contrast, there's a negative trend: more sedentary minutes lead to less calorie burning.
Key Takeaways
In short, the plot highlights two key points:
- Physical activity, measured by steps, is important for burning calories.
- Sitting for long periods (sedentary minutes) reduces calorie burning.

### The Monday Slump: Fewer Steps, Fewer Calories Burned
The data reveals a clear pattern: Monday has the lowest calorie burn because users take the fewest steps on that day. This suggests people sit more on Mondays, possibly due to work. This aligns with the idea that the users are likely working professionals, following a typical workweek schedule that starts with a busy Monday.
### Weekend Wellness Boost
On the other hand, weekends see a jump in step count. This makes sense because people generally have more free time on Saturdays and Sundays for leisure activities and spending time outdoors, leading to more movement and higher calorie burn.

### Activity Breakdown: A Look at Movement Patterns
The pie chart paints a clear picture of how users spend their time. The largest slice (81.3%) represents sedentary minutes. This suggests that most users primarily track low-intensity activities like commuting, light movement around the house, or running errands.
While the focus on daily routines is understandable, it's concerning to see such limited use (1.1% for fairly active and 1.7% for very active) for tracking dedicated fitness activities like running. This is especially noteworthy considering the FitBit app's focus on promoting and supporting an active lifestyle.

### 6. Act
Finally, from the analysis, these are my recommendations.
### 1. Enhance Features for Overall Health Habits:
Our analysis shows a high focus on sedentary tracking. I recommend we prioritize features that encourage and reward users for a wider range of health activities beyond just logging inactive movement. This could include sleep tracking, mindfulness exercises, or healthy eating challenges.
### 2. Leverage Weekday Engagement:
We observed increased activity tracking during weekdays. This presents an opportunity for targeted marketing or feature promotion. We could promote challenges, rewards, or weekday-specific features to capitalize on higher user engagement during the workweek and further motivate consistent activity.
### 3. Inspiration from Industry Trends:
Analyzing successful strategies employed by FitBit can inspire enhancements for Bellabeat. Consider features like:
- Personalized health insights: tailoring recommendations and feedback based on individual user data.
- Engaging challenges: fostering friendly competition and motivation through gamified experiences.
- Deeper health understanding: providing features that help users connect their habits with health outcomes.
### 4. Marketing Strategy Influenced by Trends:
Promote a holistic approach to health by offering educational content about fitness benefits and suggesting personalized exercise routines.
- Weekday workouts: Recommend shorter, focused exercises that fit busy schedules.
- Weekend workouts: Encourage more intense activities that capitalize on free time.
Utilize notifications as a motivational tool, especially on weekends. Reminders can nudge users to stay active and support their fitness goals.
Overall, these recommendations aim to:
- Improve user experience by addressing a wider range of health needs and interests.
- Position Bellabeat as a proactive and supportive partner in women's health and fitness journeys.
- By implementing these data-driven suggestions, we can ensure Bellabeat products remain relevant and engaging for women from all walks of life.
